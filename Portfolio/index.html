       <h2> <em> About Me </em> </h2>
       <img src = "images/matias.jpg" alt="Portrait of Matias" style = "width:200px;"/>
       <p>   I like to think of myself as an adventurer, ready to trying new things and excited to tackle everyday challenges.  This past November I started my journey to become a full stack web developer through the Laguardia CC Techhire Program. </p>

       <p> Becoming a full stack developer allows me to exhibit my creative side and use websites as my canvas. Creating software and building websites that make a positive difference in the lives of many people is something I hope to achieve as a full stack web developer. Join me on my techhire journey! </p>

       <p> My journey began with a background in biology and environmental research, which has helped shaped my interests and worldview such as in environmental stewardship.</p>

       <p> My interests include learning about topics at the intersection of biology and technology like in medicine, healthcare and biotechnology. As an artist, I enjoy drawing, painting, and using different combinations of colors and textures to create interesting pieces.</p>
