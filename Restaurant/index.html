            <p> Vanilla Manilla started as a small storefront in Cold Spring Harbor. Our founder Granny Manilla
                started her business in the 1950's with her <span style="color:coral"> <strong>famous homemade Manilla Vanilla ice cream </strong> </span>which
                was an instant sensation and was featured in the 1960's Time magazine as the best tasting manilla vanilla ice cream.
                To this day, we follow her original recipe and each batch we make is made with ground natural vanilla beans
                and churned with fresh cream from our local dairy farm. We've been in operation for over <span style="color:coral"><strong>
                60 years</strong> </span> and we strive to make ice cream with an unforgettable taste that'll keep you coming. Besides ice cream, we
                serve a variety of sandwiches, salads, cheeses, pies, and lots of baked goods. One menu item, our triple
                double stack veggie burger captured national attention as the tallest veggie burger in the world
                (over 1 foot high). <span style="color:firebrick"><strong> Come for a visit, we know you'll have an unforgettable experience!  </strong> </span>
